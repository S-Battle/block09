This is a project  where I pretend to be hired on with Full Stack Academy, the bootcamp I am currently attending.  I used a little information about me and what I may present to the employees who are working there.  I used three pages, Home, About, and Portfolio.  Each page talked a little about me.  
I input a little Javascript on the About page, you can see it when you mouseover some of the programming language images.
Thank you for reading.
